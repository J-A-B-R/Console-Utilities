Console Utilities
=================

Console Utilities are a set of lightweight Win32 console programs written in pure C that offer funtionality and console management not found on Windows.

For detailed operation, **click on the name of the command below** or check the **in-command help** with option **`/?`**. The help included on each command is in english and spanish. If the Windows locale is a spanish variant, it'll show the spanish help, otherwise it'll show the english help.


Installation
------------
You can download or clone the project and compile it for yourself or you can download a precompiled bundle. Whatever the method you choose,
put the executables in a directory included in the `PATH` environment variable.

###Bundles:

- New escaped characters and improvements to **`EECHO`**.


Personal background
-------------------
I started this little project as a fun summer entertainment to detox of .NET, OO, lambdas, ORMs, repository patterns, async programming, SOLID concepts and whatnot.

So here I am, back to basics facing the arid Win32 API that I've almost forgotten, armed only with the ancient but beloved C89 and willing to learn one thing or two.
